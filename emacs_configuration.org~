* Notes

Note that this is an experimentation integrating WSL on window emacs.

In general there are too many conflicts. The major ones discovered to
the point are the issues with "sudo orders". These cannot be properly
integrated in this WSL-Windows Emacs. Moreover this solution does not
manage to integrate properly git. Git repositories are not recognized
as such and difficulties arise when pulling and pushing.

Note however that when installing emacs on the Ubuntu partition and
calling emacs in that partition everything integrates well.

This is therefore a very nice and powerful feature and it suggest to
switch to this solution. 



* General sources

As a general resources for generating my emacs configuration I mainly
refer to [[https://cestlaz.github.io/tags/emacs/page/6/][emacs_intro_&packages]], [[https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/configuration.org][Harry Schwartz emacs config]]. Harry
Schwartz shared a video on the internet containing a good introduction
to the org mode and suggested the option of writing the emacs
configuration file as =org= file as I am currently doing, which I
enjoy a lot and believe it gives a great overview over the document.

** TODO watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK3fij-D1G8][this]] incredible video describing literate programming within Org-mode and try to incorporate the mode

* Increase cache allowed

From Howard Abraham...

With a long history of working on small machines without gigabytes of RAM, we might as well let Emacs be the beast it has always dreamed.

First, let’s increase the cache:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gc-cons-threshold 50000000)
#+END_SRC


* Shortcut to Configuration File

This section creates a shortcut key to go to this =emacs=
configuration file without having to search for the directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      (interactive)
      (find-file "C:/Users/MARCO.HASSAN/OneDrive - Zurich Insurance/Emacs/emacs_config/emacs_configuration.org"))

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'hrs/visit-emacs-config)

  ;;     (cd "C:/Users/Marco Hassan/Desktop")
  ;;     (shell)))

  ;; ;; if you want to run the above function iteractively when using emacs with M-x specify it as (interactive) at the end.

  ;; (my-bash-on-windows-shell)

  ;; ;; Necessary on windows as two shell windows are somehow opened.
  ;; (delete-window)

  ;; (setq-default explicit-shell-file-name "bash") ;; set default for shell as bash

   Not working. For me if you connect it to gitbash executable it will
   work. Try to do that tomorrow.

** TODO open windows DOS as shell.

Refer to the previous chunk. It is straight intuitive how to do that.

Define a function to open Windows DOS command prompt and operate
directly on windows operating system. This is for instance necessary
when in need of downloading pip libraries etc.

** Undo Redo Tree 
   
   This is a very nice package that allows you to expand on the basics
   emacs undo functionalities. In emacs you can undo with =C-_= or
   =C-/=.

   The package undo-tre allows you to have the redo option with
   =C-?=.

   Moreover it allows you to visualize a tree with the changes you
   have done and to move interactively across it to go back to a given
   point in you history. 

   If you code something and then cancel that something and code
   something else, the undo tree will show a branch at this stage
   with the two versions of your edit.

   Require the package and enable it globally.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package undo-tree
     :ensure t
     :init
     (global-undo-tree-mode))
   #+END_SRC

** Parenthesis

   Try this package for parenthesis highlighting. 

   Learn how to quickly operate with parenthesis using predit through
   the following link [[http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html][predit-tutorial.]]

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (autoload 'enable-paredit-mode "paredit" "Turn on pseudo-structural editing of Lisp code." t)
   #+END_SRC

   Despite being super useful paredit unfortunately conflicts with the
   usual <DEL>. This will not allow to cancel entire chunks of
   highlighted text. Set another key binding for paredit delete.

   Notice the code below removes the paredit delete altogether because
   I do not find it that useful. Another option would just to add
   another line shifting the paredit =<DEL>= to some other key binding. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load "paredit" '(define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "<DEL>") nil))

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'enable-paredit-mode) ;; notice at the moment paredit is just bound to org-mode. Expand it.
#+END_SRC


Rainbow-delimiters is convenient for coloring matching parentheses.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Beacon Mode

   This emits a short light when the you move your cursor around the
   screen in a fast way. That should help you to quickly identify
   where your cursor is and not to get lost when quickly scrolling on
   the screen.

   You can set in the parameter for deciding when the beacon should
   work. Moreover, you define how long the light should flash. For
   this and several other options check at the github repo [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][beacon]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

The performance of company increased a lot with the two global options.

*** Synchronize company with pcomplete for org mode 

    Pcomplete integrates company such that when editing headers,
    processes, title and author and any other options in org mode
    starting with =#+= it will list all of the available options.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun trigger-org-company-complete ()
  "Begins company-complete in org-mode buffer after pressing #+ chars."
  (interactive)
  (if (string-equal "#" (string (preceding-char)))

      (insert "+")
      (company-complete))
    (insert "+")))

*** Company cycle through

Very handy way to work with company such that you do not have to enter
the word you are interested in with the =RET= command but can rather
cycle through them with the =TAB= command. This will autocomplete the
word and you can then continue writing with the space.

* Snippets

Snippets are a powerful tool that consists of pre-compiled code that
you can enter through some shortcuts. You can either enter and save
your own snippet or you can leverage the already built-in
snippets. These are various and allows you for instance to create
classes, open loops, etc. 

The package for working with snippets is =yasnippet= and the
documentation for the various snippets can be found at

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package auto-yasnippet
  :ensure t
  :init
  (yas-global-mode 1))
#+END_SRC


** Yasnippet-snippets

Also download the yasnippet-snippets library. There are many more
snippets there in comparison to the one included in the auto-yasnippet
above and I believe it might be useful working with these.

In his documentation he says that all the snippets will load
automatically as soon as yasnippet loads. Let's see.

Nice. This was correct. Once you downlaod the package through MELPA or
manually setting it into your working directory the snippets will
automatically be avaiable. No need for configuration in emacs.


* Org Mode

Very nice mode.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org)
#+END_SRC

** Basic configuration: 

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp 
     ;; To open all .org files in org mode.
     (autoload 'org-mode "org-mode" "Org Mode." t)

     ;; Necessary to download org from MELPA at first.
     (use-package org)

     ;; workaround for not workign source code shortcut
     (when (version<= "9.2" (org-version))
       (require 'org-tempo))
   #+end_src

** Grammar Check

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Activate flyspell for org documents.
     (use-package flyspell
       :config
       (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode))
   #+END_SRC

** Export modes

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Exporting in markdown and beamer mode
  (require 'ox-md)
  (require 'ox-beamer)
#+END_SRC

** Layout

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Use syntax highlighting in source blocks while editing.
     (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)

     ;; Make TAB act as if it were issued in a buffer of the languages major mode.
     (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)

     ;; I like to see an outline of pretty bullets instead of a list of asterisks.
     (use-package org-bullets
       :init
       (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-bullets-mode))

     ;; I like seeing a little downward-pointing arrow instead of the usual
     ;; ellipsis (...) that org displays when there is stuff under a header.
     (setq org-ellipsis " >>")
   #+END_SRC

** Ob-ipyhton

   To run jupyter like workflow in org mode displaying graphs, using
   multiple languages etc. Notice at the moment I have issue. 

   Package is not on MELPA, but it should. Install it manually. Then you should
   be able to run the below and start to operate through in org-mode
   via ob-ipython.

   I downloaded the package manually in the =.emacs.d= folder. Load it
   adding it to your load path.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Tell emacs where is your personal elisp lib dir
     (add-to-list 'load-path "c:/Users/MARCO.HASSAN/AppData/Roaming/.emacs.d/ob-ipython/")

   #+END_SRC


   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load "obipython")

      ;;; display/update images in the buffer after I evaluate
     (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-display-inline-images 'append)
   #+END_SRC

** Shortcuts to insert chunk of code

   With the global key board shortcut you can further insert the name of
   a section in emacs.

   Notice the below method do write a lambda function that requires no
   name and previous specification and to execute it just in org-mode so
   that the shortcut is defined just for the defined mode.

   #+Name: write_name
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	       (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-c q") "#+Name: ")))
   #+END_SRC

   The next three chunck define shortcuts for creating chunck in
   different languages.

   #+Name: write_source_lisp
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	       (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-c 1") "#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp\n\n#+END_SRC")))
   #+END_SRC

   #+Name: write_source_R
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	       (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-c 2") "#+BEGIN_SRC R\n\n#+END_SRC")))
   #+END_SRC

   #+Name: write_source_python
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	       (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd "C-c 3") "#+BEGIN_SRC python\n\n#+END_SRC")))
   #+END_SRC

    The below works but I have noted that it usually takes a while to
    insert a chunk. Another viable solution is to use
    snippets. Consider that

* Automatic encryption

  Inspired by Howard Abrams. He sets the option =(setq
  epa-file-select-keys 2)= for automatically encrypting the docs with
  his public key such that he will then be able to de-crypt them using
  his private key. 

  *Notice:* The section leverages the =easy pg= package for GnuPG
  interaction on emacs. The package should  already be installed for
  Emacs >21.4. You can find it as =epg= in the list of your packages.

  Reference it at [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EasyPG][EasyPG]].

  From this source about [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/Encrypting_002fdecrypting-gpg-files.html][auto-encryption]] I could understand that a
  similar point holds also for symmetric encryption.

  Setting the parameter below emacs understands directly that it
  should work with symmetric encryption. In fact you are telling epa
  to forget about your public-private keys so to say and therefore the
  option remaining is the one of symmetric encryption.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq epa-file-select-keys nil) 
  #+END_SRC

Very nice org-mode link elaborating some other options, such as just
encrypting some part of the document etc. [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/encrypting-files.html][Encrypting Org Files]].

password directly from emacs mini-buffer and not with the opening of a
specific dialogue.

* Deal with conflicting key bindings

This is an interesting option to deal with key bindings conflicts. The
idea is to create a minor mode with the key bindings you want to have
guaranteed and subsequently solving the conflicts by enabling the
created minor mode.

Notice at the moment not used. But I had to rename already a few key
bindings. I am sure that soon I will have to leverage it and it is
therefore sensible to keep it here already.

** Use Emacsclient to speed up start up of Emacs

   Idea: run at the beginning an emacs server on the local machine and
   let the emacs instances connect to the server. Like this you will not
   need to run the entire =init= file each time you call emacs.

   The best implementation is then to start the emacs deamon letting the
   server start right after booting. Like this you will always have the
   emacs server running in the background at PC start-up.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (server-start)
   #+END_SRC

   /Notice:/ When an emacs server is running, closing the last Emacs
   instance will leave the server running.
